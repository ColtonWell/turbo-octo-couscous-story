One snowy day, John was walking down the slippery sidewalks of UW-Madison. He was walking to his favorite class, CS 400, when an idea for some groundbreaking software hit him. He knew he'd become rich beyond his wildest dreams while also making people's lives easier, but he still felt a little bad about ditching lecture to begin development. However, he decided that the work needed to start now, and so he turned around and ran back home. 

He found out his house is surrounded by policeman cars. He went to see what's going on and saw an extraterrestrial creature on his roof.
